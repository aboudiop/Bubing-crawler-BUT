/** A blocking queue holding a fixed amount of <em>timestamped</em> items. The {@link #put(Object, long)}
 * must be called with an object and a timestamp. Timestamps must be a contiguous interval of the 
 * natural numbers starting at zero, and objects will be returned in timestamp order. Failure to 
 * comply with the contract (i.e., missing timestamps) will cause the queue to block forever.
 * 
 * <p>{@link #put(Object, long)} might block if there is not enough space to keep track of the 
 * object (i.e., if its timestamp is too far in time w.r.t. the timestamp that would be
 * returned next by the queue). {@link #take()} might block if the object with the next
 * timestamp has not been {@link #put(Object, long)} yet.
 * 
 * <p>All methods of this class complete in constant time.
