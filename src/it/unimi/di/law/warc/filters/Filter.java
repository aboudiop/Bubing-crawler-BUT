/** A filter is a strategy to decide whether to accept a given 
 *  object or not. Typically <code>T</code> will be either a {@link URI}, an
 *  {@link HttpResponse} or a {@link URIResponse}. Technically it is identical to the Google Guava 
 *  {@link Predicate} interface, but there are some conventions listed 
 *  below that apply only to filters.
 *  
 *  <p>By contract, every filter that is an instance of a non-anonymous
 *  filter class is supposed to have a <strong>static</strong>
 *  method with the following signature
 *  <pre>public static Filter&lt;T&gt; valueOf(String x)</pre>
 *  that returns a filter (typically, a filter of its own kind) from
 *  a string. Moreover, it is required, for every filter class <code>F</code>
 *  and for every instance <code>f</code>, that <code>toString()</code> returns
 *  <pre><var>classname</var>(<var>spec</var>)</pre> 
 *  where <pre>f.equals(F.valueOf(<var>spec</var>))</pre>
 *  
 *  <p>Note that <code><var>classname</var></code> can omit the package name if
 *  it is {@link #FILTER_PACKAGE_NAME}.
