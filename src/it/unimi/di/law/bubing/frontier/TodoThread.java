//RELEASE-STATUS: DIST

/** A thread that continuously {@linkplain Workbench#acquire() acquires} a {@link VisitState} from the {@link Workbench} and adds it
 *  to the {@link Frontier#todo} queue. Note that we use the {@linkplain DelayQueue#take() blocking dequeue method}, which will take
 *  care of delays due to politeness, so this thread does not need to do any busy polling.
 *  {@link FetchingThread} instances will later remove the {@link VisitState} from the {@link Frontier#todo} queue.
 *  
 *  <p>This design has been chosen so to minimize contention on the {@link Workbench}, as its
 *  state changes require logarithmic time. Only this thread, the {@link DoneThread}, the {@link Distributor} and {@link DNSThread}/{@link ParsingThread} instances
 *  access directly the {@link Workbench}&mdash;access by {@link FetchingThread} and {@link ParsingThread} instances is mediated
 *  by the {@link Frontier#todo} wait-free queue. As a side-effect, if a {@link VisitState} with a very low {@link VisitState#nextFetch}
 *  value comes back to life, it will be placed in the correct position on the  {@link Workbench}, 
 *  but not in the {@link Frontier#todo} queue.
